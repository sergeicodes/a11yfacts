# Accessibility Facts

To help businesses to **make their decisions** towards accessibility, it would be nice to have a place where **different facts about accessibility are collected**. For better readability all facts should be supported by **infographics** (see some good examples below). **References** to all facts should be provided.

## Ideas

* Facts can be filtered by **categories or/and tags** (disability type, geo location, social group, etc.)
* Fact cards are collected on a landing page, but there are **separate pages** for each fact (with references and supporting info)
* Facts should be **shareable** and beautifully **presented** in social platforms once shared, so people could easily memorize them and wanted to show them to their colleagues
