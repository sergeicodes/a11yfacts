# Accessibility Facts

To help businesses to make their decisions towards accessibility, it would be nice to have a place where different facts about accessibility are collected. For better readability all facts should be supported by illustrations. References to all facts should be provided.

## Ideas

* Facts can be filtered by categories (disability type, geo location, social group, etc.)
* Fact cards are collected on a landing page, but there are separate pages for each fact (with references and supporting info)
* Facts can be published as text, illustrations can be added later
